# Project Setup and Approach

## Overview
This project is a React application utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and component-based UI development. Initially, we attempted to integrate Flowbite React, but due to compatibility issues, we opted for an alternative library.

## Approach
1. **React Setup**: The project is created using `create-react-app`, ensuring a structured and maintainable setup.
2. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Configured Tailwind for optimized styling.
3. **Alternative UI Library**: Instead of Flowbite React, I implemented **DaisyUI** for ready-to-use Tailwind components, ensuring compatibility and responsiveness.
4. **Component-Based Design**: Following a modular architecture for reusability and scalability.

## Installation
To install dependencies and run the project:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Alternative UI Library Setup
Since Flowbite React caused compatibility issues, we integrated **DaisyUI**:
1. Install DaisyUI:
   ```sh
   npm install daisyui
   ```
2. Add to `tailwind.config.js`:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     plugins: [require("daisyui")],
   };
   ```

## Issues Faced & Solutions
- **Flowbite React Compatibility**: Resolved by switching to DaisyUI.
- **Tailwind PostCSS Errors**: Fixed by ensuring correct Tailwind version and reconfiguring PostCSS.

## Conclusion
This project follows a modular and optimized approach, ensuring efficient UI development with Tailwind CSS and alternative component libraries.
